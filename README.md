# Backend-mySQL-ExpressJS

Is an api implemented with expressJS using mySQL as databes.
In this repo, I used the row query for the *CURD* operation.

## Before starting:
-[ ] Go to the project's root folder and run `npm install`.
-[ ] Create a **start** script in the `package.json` file to run the server in `index.js`
-[ ] Run `npm start` and test the application
## Folder structure:

   -[ ] `Backend-mySQL-ExpressJS`: the  project's root folder.

   -[ ] `Controllers`: Controllers act as an interface between Model and View components to process all the business logic and incoming requests, manipulate data using the Model and interact with the Views to render the final output

   -[ ] `models`: The Model  corresponds to all the data-related logic that the user works with.

   -[ ] `routes`:refers to how an applicationâ€™s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests.

 #### `index.js` : Where the express server was implemented.
 #### `package.json` : is a JSON file that exists at the root of the project,It holds metadata relevant to the project and it is used for managing the project's dependencies, scripts, version and a whole lot more.
